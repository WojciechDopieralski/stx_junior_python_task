# stx_junior_python_task

### API is available online at: https://stxtaskbooksapi.herokuapp.com/

### If you would like to test this API locally you have to: 
1. Fork and clone repo.
2. Run ~pip3 install -r requirements.txt~ to install all libraries 
3. remove dots "." from "api.py" file in import section. Dots are needed for heroku deployment! 
4. This API uses MongoDB. It would be best to create your own free DB at: https://cloud.mongodb.com
5. You will need to change uri parameter inside "dbconn.py" to your own uri (generated from your MongoDB)
6. inside api folder create pickled file named "pass.p". It should contain pickled string. I attached "pass_example.p".
7. If you would like to put your project online use heroku not pythonanywhere. Pythonanywhere doesn't support MongoDB as free account package.
